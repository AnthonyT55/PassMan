Simple CLI password manager created in Java. Currently still working on certain features (decryption key creation and proper storage). In the present this program comes with: a menu, file encryption and decryption, password generation, user deletion, and passwords file creation. This program creates a password file in .txt, then encrypts it and stores it as a .enc file and ciphers the information and presents the user with a menu.
